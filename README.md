##Salesight AI

Intelligent Sales Forecasting using Deep Neural Networks

‚∏ª

üìò Overview

Salesight AI is a machine learning‚Äìdriven sales forecasting system that predicts the profitability of automobile sales using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN).
This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques, statistical preprocessing, and scalable architecture to forecast sales performance with improved accuracy and explainability.

The goal is to assist automotive businesses and analysts in identifying high-potential, profitable products and improving data-driven decision-making across operations and marketing pipelines.
